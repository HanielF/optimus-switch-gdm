# optimus-switch-gdm
modified version to work with gdm/gnome. includes install script. made for manjaro linux.


usage after running install script:  

`sudo set-intel.sh` will set intel only mode, reboot and nvidia powered off and removed from view.

`sudo set-nvidia.sh`  sets intel/nvidia (prime) mode.

simple instruction's coming soon. if you cant figure it out, i am @dglt on manjaro's forum.
